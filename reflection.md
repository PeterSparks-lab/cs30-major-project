# Reflection

## Advice to self if I ever do a project like this again

-Next time I should try to be more efficient time-wise as I almost didn't finish
-I should figure out a more efficient way to design backgrounds for rooms as sometimes they wouldn't line up properly
-finish all the rooms before doing anything else

## Hardest part of the project

The hardest part of this project was implementing the rooms because sometimes my math would be off when making the backgrounds that they go along with and then I would have to 
completly redo each room so the wass would fit together with the background, It is also extremly tedious to make each one by hand.

## Did I complete the Needs to Have List?

I was able to complete the needs to have list and included music, different dragon variants, most things are objects, and the external files are loaded into 2-5 arrays to create the game world. I was also able to include more than 2 dragon variants (green, blue, white, and black dragons) but I wasn't able to include multiple difficulties or game worlds. I also fixed the bugs discovered in beta testing.

## Most Proud Of
The thing I am most proud of is the Item class because I was able to make it so that all the items are in the same class instead of having two classes for keys and weapons. I am also proud that I was able to finish the project on time
