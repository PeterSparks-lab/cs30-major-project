# Reflection

## Advice to self if I ever do a project like this again

-Next time I should try to be more efficient time-wise as I almost didn't finish
-I should figure out a more efficient way to design backgrounds for rooms as sometimes they wouldn't line up properly
-finish all the rooms before doing anything else

## Hardest part of the project

The hardest part of this project was implementing the rooms because sometimes my math would be off when making the backgrounds they go along with and then I would have to 
completly redo each room so the wass would fit together with the background, It is also extremly tedious to make each one by hand.

## Did I complete the Needs to Have List?
